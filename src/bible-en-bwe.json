She was shouting, These men are servants of the High God. They are telling us how to be saved."},{"verse":"18","text":"She did this for many days. This troubled Paul. He turned and said to the spirit in her, In the name of Jesus Christ, I say to you, come out of her!

They now believed in God."},{"verse":"35","text":"In the morning the judges sent soldiers to the guard with a message. Let those men go free, they said."},{"verse":"36","text":"The guard told Paul. He said, The judges have sent a message that you may go free. So now, come out and go on your way. You will have no more trouble."},{"verse":"37","text":"But Paul said, We are Romans.

No, they themselves must come and take us out."},{"verse":"38","text":"The soldiers told this to the judges. They were very much afraid when they heard that Paul and Silas were Romans."},{"verse":"39","text":"So they came to Paul and Silas. They said they were sorry for what they had done. They brought them out of prison and asked them to leave the city."},{"verse":"40","text":"When Paul and Silas came out of prison, they went back to Lydias house.

It was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise again from death. And this Jesus, whom I am talking about, is the Christ."},{"verse":"4","text":"Some of the people believed him and they followed Paul and Silas. Some of them were Greek people who worshipped God. And some were leading women."},{"verse":"5","text":"But some Jews did not believe, and they were jealous. So they called some of the bad men together and made a crowd. They started to fight and to make plenty of trouble and noise in the city. At Jasons house they went in by force to find Paul and Silas. They wanted to bring them outside to the people."},{"verse":"6","text":"But they did not find them. So they took Jason and some of the Christian brothers to the rulers of the city.

In the market every day, he talked to people he met there."},{"verse":"18","text":"There were some wise men who believed the teachings of Epicurius. They believed the teaching of other wise men called Stoics. Some of them began to talk with Paul. And some said, What does this talker have to say? Others said, He seems to be talking about new gods. This was because he was telling them about Jesus and how he was raised from death."},{"verse":"19","text":"So they took Paul and brought him to a meeting at the hill called Areopagus. They said, We want to know what this new teaching is that you are talking about."},{"verse":"20","text":"You are telling us things we never heard before.

I am ready to be tied and also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."},{"verse":"14","text":"So when we saw that he would not change his mind, we stopped begging him. We said, May the Lord do what he wants to be done."},{"verse":"15","text":"After that, we took our things and went to Jerusalem."},{"verse":"16","text":"Some of the Christians from Caesarea went with us.

They said to Paul, Brother, there are many thousands of Jews who believe. They all say we must obey the law of Moses."},{"verse":"21","text":"They have heard that you teach all the Jews who live in other lands. They heard that you tell them not to obey Moses law: that they need not circumcise their children like the Jews do; and they can leave the Jewish ways of living."},{"verse":"22","text":"What should we do about it? Many people will gather together because they will surely hear that you have come."},{"verse":"23","text":"Now then, do the thing we tell you. We have four men who have made a promise."},{"verse":"24","text":"Take them with you. Make yourself clean with them, the way the law says to do. Pay the cost for having their hair cut.

And they must not take part in any kind of wrong sexual behaviour between men and women."},{"verse":"26","text":"Then Paul took the men with him. The next day he made himself clean with them the way the law says to do. Then he went into the temple. He told the priests which day they would finish making themselves clean. On that day a sacrifice would be made for each one of them."},{"verse":"27","text":"The seven days were almost over. The Jewish leaders from Asia Minor saw Paul in the temple. They got all the people there excited. They caught hold of him."},{"verse":"28","text":"They shouted, All you men of Israel, come and help us! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere not to respect our people. He says we need not obey the law or respect this temple. And what is more, he has brought Greek people into the temple. He has made this holy place unclean."},{"verse":"29","text":"They said this because they had seen a man from Ephesus named Trophimus. He was in the city with Paul. And they thought that Paul had brought him into the temple."},{"verse":"30","text":"So all the people in the city were excited. They came running. They caught Paul and took him out of the temple by force. Then the doors were shut behind them."},{"verse":"31","text":"They were trying to kill him. The officer in charge of the soldiers heard that all the people of Jerusalem were making trouble."},{"verse":"32","text":"Right away he took some soldiers and officers with him and ran down to the people.

So, you speak the Greek language! said the officer. I thought you were the man from the country of Egypt who made trouble a while ago. I thought you were the one who led four thousand bad men into the desert."},{"verse":"39","text":"Paul said, I am a Jew. I was born in the city of Tarsus in Cilicia. I belong to a great city. Please let me talk to these people."},{"verse":"40","text":"So the officer let him talk. Paul stood on the steps and put up his hand. Then all the people were very quiet. He talked to them in the Jews language."}],[{"verse":"1","text":"Paul said, Men, brothers, and fathers, listen while I tell you my side of this matter."},{"verse":"2","text":"When the people heard him speak in the Jews language, they were even more quiet. Then Paul said, I am a Jew. I was born in the city of Tarsus in Cilicia. But I was raised here in this city. Gamaliel was my teacher. He taught me very well in the law of our fathers. I was trying hard to obey God, just as you all are today."},{"verse":"4","text":"I troubled very much the people who believed this Way. I even killed them. I had men and women tied and put into prison."},{"verse":"5","text":"The high priest and all the leaders know that this is true about me. They wrote letters for me to carry to the leaders of the Jews in the city of Damascus. I went to have the Christians there tied and brought to Jerusalem to be punished."},{"verse":"6","text":"I was on my way and was near Damascus. It was about midday. All at once a very bright light from the sky shone all around me."},{"verse":"7","text":"I fell to the ground and heard someone say to me, \"Saul, Saul, why are you troubling me?\""},{"verse":"8","text":"I said, \"Who are you, Lord?\" He answered, \"I am Jesus of Nazareth. You are troubling me.\""},{"verse":"9","text":"The men who were with me saw the light. They were afraid. But they did not hear the one who spoke to me."},{"verse":"10","text":"Then I said, \"Lord, what shall I do?\" And the Lord said to me, \"Get up and go to Damascus. There someone will tell you all you must do.\""},{"verse":"11","text":"I could not see because the light was so bright. My friends led me by the hand to Damascus."},{"verse":"12","text":"A man named Ananias was there. He obeyed the law of Moses, and all the Jews who lived there spoke well of him."},{"verse":"13","text":"He came to see me. He stood by my side and said to me, \"Brother Saul, you can see again!\" And right then I was able to see him."},{"verse":"14","text":"He said, \"The God of our fathers has chosen you to know his will. He chose you to see the One who is right and to hear him speak."},{"verse":"15","text":"You will speak for him. You will tell all the people what you have seen and heard."},{"verse":"16","text":"Now, why do you wait? Get up and be baptised. Wash away your wrong ways by calling on the name of the Lord!\""},{"verse":"17","text":"After I went back to Jerusalem, I was talking to God in the temple one day. Something like a dream came over me."},{"verse":"18","text":"I heard the Lord say to me, \"Leave Jerusalem quickly, right away. The people will not listen to the things you say about me.\""},{"verse":"19","text":"And I said, \"Lord, they know that I put in prison those who believed in you. I beat them in all the meeting houses."},{"verse":"20","text":"And I stood by and let people kill Stephen. He was one who talked for you. I looked after the clothes of the men who killed him.\""},{"verse":"21","text":"But the Lord said to me, \"Go! I will send you far away to the people who are not Jews.\""},{"verse":"22","text":"The people listened to Paul until he said that. Then they shouted, Kill him and get him off the earth. A man like that should not live!"},{"verse":"23","text":"The people shouted. They waved their clothes about and threw dust in the air."},{"verse":"24","text":"The man in charge of the soldiers ordered Paul to be brought into the army house. He said that he should be beaten hard to make him tell why the people shouted so much at him."},{"verse":"25","text":"When they had tied him with ropes, Paul said to the captain who was standing by, Is it right for you to beat a man who belongs to Rome without judging his case?"},{"verse":"26","text":"When the captain heard this, he told the commanding officer. He said, What are you going to do? This man is a Roman!"},{"verse":"27","text":"Then the commanding officer came to Paul and said, Tell me, are you a Roman? Yes, I am, replied Paul."},{"verse":"28","text":"Then the officer said, I paid much money to become a Roman. Paul said, I was born a Roman."},{"verse":"29","text":"Then the men who were going to beat him left him. The officer was afraid when he knew Paul was a Roman, because he had tied him up."},{"verse":"30","text":"The officer wanted to know the real reason why the Jewish leaders were angry with Paul. So the next day he had Paul untied. He called the chief priests and the leaders to hold a court meeting.

You sit there to judge me by the law and you break the law by telling them to hit me."},{"verse":"4","text":"The people who stood near Paul said, Do you say a wrong thing like that to Gods high priest?"},{"verse":"5","text":"Paul said, I did not know that he is a high priest. The holy writings say, \"You shall not say anything wrong about a ruler of your people.\""},{"verse":"6","text":"Paul knew that some of the men were from the Sadducee group and some of them were from the Pharisee group. So he called out in the court, My brothers, I am a Pharisee. My fathers were Pharisees. I am being judged because I believe that the dead will be raised to life again."},{"verse":"7","text":"When he had said that, the Pharisees and the Sadducees began to talk back and forth. The men in the court were divided."},{"verse":"8","text":"The Sadducees say the dead will not be raised again. They say there is no angel or spirit. But the Pharisees believe in all these three things."},{"verse":"9","text":"There was much shouting. Some of the clever men who were Pharisees got up. They said, We do not think this man has done wrong. Perhaps some angel or spirit really did speak to him."},{"verse":"10","text":"The people started fighting.

I told those who are making complaints against him that they must bring the matter to you."},{"verse":"31","text":"So the soldiers took Paul as they had been told to do.

He said, I have done no wrong to the law, or to the temple, or against Caesar the ruler of the Romans."},{"verse":"9","text":"Festus wanted to please the Jewish leaders, so he said to Paul, Will you go to Jerusalem and let me judge you there about these things?"},{"verse":"10","text":"Paul said, I am standing in Caesars court.

You yourself know that well."},{"verse":"11","text":"If I have done wrong things, or any wrong thing for which I should die, then I do not ask to live. But if the things these people say are not true, then no one has power to give me up to the leaders of the Jews.

All right, you will go to Caesar!"},{"verse":"13","text":"Some time after that, king Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus."},{"verse":"14","text":"They stayed for many days. Festus brought Pauls matter to the king. He said, Felix left a man in prison here."},{"verse":"15","text":"When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priest and leaders of the Jews came to me. They talked against him, and they asked me to punish him."},{"verse":"16","text":"I told them that the Romans do not do it that way. They do not punish a man until he has met those who talk against him. Then he has a chance to speak for himself."},{"verse":"17","text":"So they came here with me. I did not wait. The very next day I sat on my chair in the court and had the man brought in."},{"verse":"18","text":"When they stood up, they did not say the wrong things against him that I thought they would."},{"verse":"19","text":"But instead, they had a quarrel with him about the things they believe in. The quarrel is about a man named Jesus who died. Paul said he is alive."},{"verse":"20","text":"I did not know how to judge such things. So I asked if he would go to Jerusalem and be judged there about these matters."},{"verse":"21","text":"But Paul asked to wait and let Caesar judge his case. So I had him put in prison to be kept there until I can send him to Caesar."},{"verse":"22","text":"Agrippa said to Festus, I should like to hear the man myself. Festus said, Tomorrow you shall hear him."},{"verse":"23","text":"So the next day Agrippa and Bernice came, making a big show of themselves. They went into the room to hear Paul talk. Officers and the leading men of the city also went in. When Festus called for Paul, he was brought in."},{"verse":"24","text":"Then Festus said, King Agrippa and all you men here with us, you see this man. All the Jewish leaders, both in Jerusalem and here, came together and talked about him. They shouted, \"He must die!\""},{"verse":"25","text":"But I found out that he had not done anything wrong for which he should die. He himself asked to go to Caesar, so I decided to send him."},{"verse":"26","text":"But I have no real complaint about him to write to my ruler. So I have brought this man before you all, and most of all before you, king Agrippa. When you have heard him, I hope I will have something to write about him."},{"verse":"27","text":"I think that it does not make sense to send a prisoner and not say what wrong he has done."}],[{"verse":"1","text":"Then Agrippa said to Paul, You may speak for yourself. So Paul put out his hand and began to speak."},{"verse":"2","text":"King Agrippa, I am happy to speak for myself before you today.

So please take time to listen to me."},{"verse":"4","text":"All the Jews know the way I lived from the time I was young. From the beginning I lived with my own people at Jerusalem."},{"verse":"5","text":"They have known me for a long time. They know, if they would tell it, that I lived like the Pharisee group. They obey the law better than any others who worship God the way we do."},{"verse":"6","text":"I believe that God will keep the promise that he made to our fathers long ago. That is why I am standing here being judged today."},{"verse":"7","text":"All the people of our twelve tribes serve God faithfully day and night. They do this because they believe they will receive what he has promised. Because I believe this, king Agrippa, the Jewish leaders are talking against me."},{"verse":"8","text":"Why is it so hard for any of you to believe that God should raise the dead?"},{"verse":"9","text":"I used to think that I must do many things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth."},{"verse":"10","text":"I did this in Jerusalem. The chief priests gave me power. I put many of Gods people in prison. And when they were killed, I agreed to it."},{"verse":"11","text":"Often I punished them in all the meeting places. I tried to make them say wrong things about Christ. I was very, very angry. I even went to other cities to trouble them."},{"verse":"12","text":"And so I was on my way to the city of Damascus. The chief priests had given me power and a letter."},{"verse":"13","text":"I was on the road at midday, king Agrippa, and I saw a bright light. It came from the sky and was brighter than the light of the sun. It shone all around me and the men who were travelling with me."},{"verse":"14","text":"We all fell to the ground. I heard someone say to me in the Jews language, \"Saul, Saul, why are you troubling me? You hurt yourself when you kick against the sticks which guide you.\""},{"verse":"15","text":"I said, \"Who are you, Lord?\" And the Lord said, \"I am Jesus, the one you are troubling."},{"verse":"16","text":"But get up. Stand on your feet. Here is why I have shown myself to you. I have chosen you to work for me. I have chosen you to tell people what you saw when you saw me today. You are to tell them also about the other times when I will show myself to you."},{"verse":"17","text":"I will keep you safe from your own people, the Jews. And I will keep you safe from those who are not Jews. I am sending you to them."},{"verse":"18","text":"I send you to them to open their eyes. Then they will turn from darkness to light. You are to take them out of Satans power and turn them to God, to be forgiven of their wrong ways. Then they will be among those who are made clean and pure by believing in me.\""},{"verse":"19","text":"So, king Agrippa, I obeyed what the one from heaven told me to do."},{"verse":"20","text":"I told the good news to the people of Damascus and Jerusalem. Then I told it all over Judea. I went to those who are not Jews. I told everyone that they must stop doing wrong things and turn to God. I told them they must show by the way they live that they have stopped doing wrong things."},{"verse":"21","text":"That is why the leaders of the Jews caught me in the temple and tried to kill me."},{"verse":"22","text":"God has always helped me up to today. I have stood and talked to both small people and great people. I have said nothing more than what the prophets and Moses said would happen."},{"verse":"23","text":"They said Christ must suffer. They said he would be the first person to rise from death. He would be the first person to bring news of light to the Jews and those who are not Jews."},{"verse":"24","text":"While Paul was saying these things Festus shouted, Paul, you are crazy! All your book learning is making you crazy."},{"verse":"25","text":"Paul said, No, great ruler Festus, I am not crazy. But what I say is true. It makes good sense."},{"verse":"26","text":"The king knows about these things. I am not afraid to talk to him about them. I am sure that not one of these things happened without his knowing about it. This did not happen in secret."},{"verse":"27","text":"King Agrippa do you believe the prophets? I know you believe them."},{"verse":"28","text":"Then Agrippa said to Paul, You are trying to make me a Christian right away."},{"verse":"29","text":"Right away or later, said Paul. I wish that all who hear me today might be what I am. That is, what I am without these chains."},{"verse":"30","text":"Then king Agrippa stood up. Festus and Bernice and those who were sitting there with them stood up also."},{"verse":"31","text":"They left the room and talked the matter over. They said, This man is not doing anything wrong for which he ought to be in prison or die."},{"verse":"32","text":"Agrippa said to Festus, We could let this man go free if he had not asked to go to Caesar."}],[{"verse":"1","text":"It was planned that we would go by boat to Italy. An officer named Julius was put in charge of Paul and some other prisoners. Julius was an army captain in the Augustan group."},{"verse":"2","text":"We got on a boat which was from the city of Adramyttium. This boat was going along the coast of Asia Minor. And so we went out to sea. A man named Aristarchus from the city of Thessalonica in Macedonia came with us also."},{"verse":"3","text":"The next day we stopped at the city of Sidon. Julius was kind to Paul. He allowed him to go to see his friends so they could care for him."},{"verse":"4","text":"Then we started out to sea again. We went near the island of Cyprus, because the wind was blowing against us."},{"verse":"5","text":"We crossed the sea by the countries of Cilicia and Pamphylia.

But he listened to the captain and the owner of the boat."},{"verse":"12","text":"This place was not a good place for the boat to stay through the winter months of the year.

The winds do not blow against them."},{"verse":"13","text":"When the south wind began to blow a little, they thought they had what they wanted. So they started off. They went along very close to the land of Crete."},{"verse":"14","text":"But soon a very strong north-east wind blew from Crete."},{"verse":"15","text":"The wind blew against the boat and it could not go into the wind. So they let the boat go where the wind took it."},{"verse":"16","text":"We came close to a small island called Clauda. There we had a hard time to pull up the small boat."},{"verse":"17","text":"However, at last they got it up. Then they put ropes around the boat to make it strong. They were also afraid they would get stuck in a bad place in the sand. So they took down the big sail cloth that was up to catch the wind.

They threw out the things that were in the boat."},{"verse":"19","text":"And the third day they threw off the things they used on the boat, with their own hands."},{"verse":"20","text":"For many days we could not see the sun or the stars.

Only the boat will break and be lost."},{"verse":"23","text":"I belong to God and worship him. Last night his angel stood before me."},{"verse":"24","text":"He said, \"Paul, do not be afraid. You must stand before Caesar. And see, God has given you the lives of all these men who are travelling with you.\""},{"verse":"25","text":"So be glad, sirs. I believe God. It will be just the way he told me."},{"verse":"26","text":"However, we will have to go on an island."},{"verse":"27","text":"On the fourteenth night we were being blown across the Adrian Sea. About midnight the boatmen thought that we must be near some land."},{"verse":"28","text":"So they tested how deep the water was there. They found that the line went down twenty arm lengths. A little later they tested and found that it was only fifteen arm lengths deep."},{"verse":"29","text":"Then they were afraid that we would hit the rocks. There were four heavy iron hooks called anchors. They let them down into the water at the back end of the boat. Then they wished that morning would come."},{"verse":"30","text":"The boatmen wanted to get off and leave the boat. They even put down the small boat into the water. They said they were going to put more anchors out from the front of the big boat."},{"verse":"31","text":"But Paul said to the officer and soldiers, If these men do not stay on the boat, you cannot be saved."},{"verse":"32","text":"Then the soldiers cut the ropes holding the small boat and let the water carry it away."},{"verse":"33","text":"When it was almost morning, Paul begged them all to eat. He said, Today is the fourteenth day that you have been watching and have not eaten anything."},{"verse":"34","text":"So now, I beg you, eat something. You need it to make you strong so you can save yourselves. Not one of you will lose even one hair from your head."},{"verse":"35","text":"When he had said this, he stood in front of them all. He took some bread and thanked God for it. Then he broke it and began to eat it."},{"verse":"36","text":"Then they all were glad and ate some food themselves."},{"verse":"37","text":"In all, we were 276 people on the boat."},{"verse":"38","text":"They ate all they wanted. Then they threw the grain into the water, so that the boat would not be so heavy."},{"verse":"39","text":"In the morning they saw land. But they did not know what country it was. They saw a sandy place. So they talked it over and thought they would try to get the boat on it."},{"verse":"40","text":"They cut off the anchors and left them in the water. At the same time, they untied the wood that guided the boat. They put up the big sail to catch the wind and tried to get the boat onto that sandy place."},{"verse":"41","text":"But they came to a place where there was sand under the water. The boat stuck in it. The front end stuck so badly that they could not make it go. The back end began to break up because the water beat it so hard."},{"verse":"42","text":"The soldiers wanted to kill the prisoners so that none of them would swim to land and run away."},{"verse":"43","text":"But the officer wanted to save Paul, so he stopped the soldiers. He told the people, Those of you who can swim, jump into the water first and get to the land."},{"verse":"44","text":"Then the rest of you jump in and go on planks and other pieces of the boat.

A bad snake came out of the heat and hung onto his hand."},{"verse":"4","text":"The people of Malta saw the snake hanging on his hand. Oh, they said to each other. This man has no doubt killed someone. He did not die in the water, but it is not right for him to live."},{"verse":"5","text":"Paul shook the snake off into the fire. It did not hurt him."},{"verse":"6","text":"The people thought surely he would swell up or would drop down dead at once. They waited a long time and saw that nothing bad happened to him.

He took us to his house for three days and was very kind to us."},{"verse":"8","text":"The father of Publius was sick with fever, and blood was coming from his body. Paul went to see him. He talked to God and put his hands on the man. He healed him."},{"verse":"9","text":"After this, other sick people on the island came to Paul.

We are waiting for God to finish making us his sons. Then our bodies will be set free."},{"verse":"24","text":"That is what we hoped for when we were saved.

He has been taken away from among bad people, and taken up higher than the sky."},{"verse":"27","text":"He does not need to make sacrifices every day. The other high priests make sacrifices every day, first for the wrong things they have done, and then for the people. He did it once when he offered himself as the sacrifice."},{"verse":"28","text":"The law makes men high priests, and they are weak. But the word of Gods promise came after the law. It makes his Son high priest for ever, and he is all right."}],[{"verse":"1","text":"The real point of what we are saying is this. We now have a high priest who sits beside Gods throne or chief chair in heaven."},{"verse":"2","text":"He is priest in the true holy place where God lives.

So this high priest must have something to offer also."},{"verse":"4","text":"If he were still on earth, he would not be a priest. There are priests on earth already who offer gifts the way the law says."},{"verse":"5","text":"The work they do shows what the work of the priest in heaven is. When Moses made a house for God, here is what God told him to do. He said, Be sure you make everything like I showed you on the mountain."},{"verse":"6","text":"But Christ has been given a much better work, because he is the man who is between God and men in making an agreement. This is a much better agreement. It was made by better promises."},{"verse":"7","text":"If the first agreement had been all right, there would have been no need to make another."},{"verse":"8","text":"When the people had done wrong, Gods words to them were, The days will come, the Lord says, when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah."},{"verse":"9","text":"It will not be like the agreement that I made with their fathers. I made that agreement the day I led them by the hand out of the country of Egypt.

When a thing is old and no good, it is about ready to be thrown away."}],[{"verse":"1","text":"The first agreement had laws about worship. And it had a holy place on earth where the agreement was kept."},{"verse":"2","text":"A house was made. In the first part of the house were the light, the table, and the bread of God. This first part was called the Holy Place."},{"verse":"3","text":"The next part of the house was called the Most Holy Place."},{"verse":"4","text":"In the Most Holy Place was a pan made of gold. In this pan a fire could burn to make a sweet-smelling smoke. The box of the agreement was also in the Most Holy Place. It was covered all over with gold. In this box were: the golden pot, which had some of the food God sent from heaven for the people in the desert; Aarons stick which grew flowers on it; and the stones which had Gods agreement written on them."},{"verse":"5","text":"On top of the box were the shapes of two angels. They showed that God is great. Their wings spread over the cover of the box. It was the place where God showed that he is kind. But we cannot take time to tell about every part of these things now."},{"verse":"6","text":"These things were made ready. The priests always went into the first part of the house to do their work for God."},{"verse":"7","text":"But only the high priest went into the second part. And he went in only once a year. He never went in without taking blood with him. He gave the blood to God for the wrong things he had done and for the wrong things people had done."},{"verse":"8","text":"This is how the Holy Spirit showed that the way into the Most Holy Place was not yet open to everybody. It was not open as long as the first house was still standing."},{"verse":"9","text":"This first part is a picture of the time we are in now. In it gifts and sacrifices are made to God. But they cannot make a persons heart clean to worship God."},{"verse":"10","text":"These are only things to eat and drink and different kinds of washings. They are laws made for the body until the time when everything is made right again."},{"verse":"11","text":"But Christ has come as the high priest of the good things which have come. He went through a greater and better house which was not made by mens hands. It is not a part of this world."},{"verse":"12","text":"He did not take the blood of goats and young cows. He took his own blood. And he went into the Most Holy Place just once. He paid for our sins and made us free for ever."},{"verse":"13","text":"The priest takes the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes from a young cow that has been burned. He puts this on the people who have done wrong things. This makes their bodies clean."},{"verse":"14","text":"If the blood of animals can do that, then the blood of Christ will clean our hearts much better. Christ gave himself to God as the sacrifice. He did this by the Spirit who lives for ever. He was a perfect sacrifice. He will clean our hearts from useless acts of worship. Then we can serve the living God."},{"verse":"15","text":"That is why he is the middle man of a new agreement. He died and paid for the wrong things that were done under the first agreement. Because he is a middle man, those people who are called by God can have what he promised. This will belong to them for ever."},{"verse":"16","text":"A person can say who will get his things when he dies. He writes this agreement down. Before anyone can have them, it must be proved that the person has died."},{"verse":"17","text":"The agreement has no power until the one who made it has died. It has no power as long as the one who made it is living."},{"verse":"18","text":"So even the old agreement made by God was not begun without blood."},{"verse":"19","text":"Moses told all the people every part of the law. Then he took the blood of young cows and goats. He put some of the blood on the book of the law itself and on all the people. He took water and red wool and a plant called hyssop."},{"verse":"20","text":"As he did this, he said, This is the blood for the agreement which God has made for you."},{"verse":"21","text":"In the same way, he put some of the blood on the house he had made for God, and on all the things that were used in worship."},{"verse":"22","text":"Yes, by the old law almost everything is made clean with blood. If no animal is killed to give blood, then there is no way for people to be forgiven for the wrong things they have done."},{"verse":"23","text":"These things on earth show in a little way what things in heaven are like. The things on earth had to be cleaned by the blood of animals. But the things in heaven had to be cleaned with better sacrifices than these."},{"verse":"24","text":"Christ did not go into a holy place made by mens hands. The holy places on earth only show in a little way what the true holy place in heaven is like. He went into heaven itself. Now he stands before God for our sake."},{"verse":"25","text":"Christ did not have to offer himself as a sacrifice many times. He is not like the high priest who went into the Holy Place every year and took blood that was not his own blood."},{"verse":"26","text":"If Christ were like him, he would have had to die many times ever since the world was first made. But as it is now, Christ came once in the last days of the world. He came to clean away what is wrong by giving himself as a sacrifice."},{"verse":"27","text":"People must die, and after that they will be judged."},{"verse":"28","text":"So Christ gave himself as a sacrifice only once. He took on himself the wrong things many people have done. He will come a second time. But he will not come to do anything about the wrong things people have done. He will come to save those who are looking and waiting for him."}],[{"verse":"1","text":"The law can show only a little about the good things that are coming. It cannot show the good things themselves. People come to worship God. But the law can never make them all right by the same sacrifices that are brought every year."},{"verse":"2","text":"If the law could make people all right, they would stop making sacrifices. The people who come to worship would be made clean for all time, and they would not remember the wrong things they had done."},{"verse":"3","text":"But, by making these sacrifices, they show that they do remember the wrong things they have done."},{"verse":"4","text":"The blood of bulls and goats can never clean wrong things from peoples hearts."},{"verse":"5","text":"That is why Christ said when he came into the world, You did not want sacrifices and gifts. But you made a body for me."},{"verse":"6","text":"Animals that are burned for sacrifices, and animals killed to clean away the wrong things that people do, did not satisfy you."},{"verse":"7","text":"Then I said, \"See, I have come to do what you, God, want me to do.\" This is what is written about me in the book of the law."},{"verse":"8","text":"First he said, You did not want sacrifices and gifts, and animals that are given to be burned as sacrifices, and animals killed to clean away peoples wrong ways. You did not like them. These sacrifices are made to obey the law."},{"verse":"9","text":"Then he said, See, I have come to do what you want me to do. He took away the first kind of sacrifices so that the second kind would remain."},{"verse":"10","text":"God wanted us to be made holy. We have been made holy by Jesus Christ. He made us holy by once making his body a sacrifice."},{"verse":"11","text":"Every priest stands day after day doing his work. He makes the same sacrifices many times. But these sacrifices can never clean away the wrong things people have done."},{"verse":"12","text":"But Christ made one sacrifice to clean away their wrong ways for ever. Then he sat down beside God."},{"verse":"13","text":"Since then, he is waiting till his enemies are put under him."},{"verse":"14","text":"By one sacrifice Christ has made right for ever all those people who are being made holy."},{"verse":"15","text":"The Holy Spirit tells us about this also."},{"verse":"16","text":"First he said, This is the agreement that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts. I will write them in their minds."},{"verse":"17","text":"Then he also said, I will never remember the wrong things they have done and the times they did not obey."},{"verse":"18","text":"When these wrong things have been forgiven, a sacrifice is not needed for them again."},{"verse":"19","text":"So, my brothers, we can go into the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus."},{"verse":"20","text":"He made a new and living way for us. He opened up Gods way specially for us. It lets us through the big curtain or cloth which hides God from us. This happened when Jesus gave his body as a sacrifice."},{"verse":"21","text":"Also, we have a high priest who has charge of Gods people."},{"verse":"22","text":"So let us come to him with a true heart. Let us come because we believe all these things. Let us come with our hearts washed clean from our wrong ways. Let us come with our bodies washed with clean water."},{"verse":"23","text":"We must hold on to Gods promise that we have said we believed. And we must never let go.

If we do, then there is no sacrifice any more for the wrong things we do."},{"verse":"27","text":"But we will be judged, and that makes us fear. Gods anger will be like a very hot fire that will burn up those who are against him."},{"verse":"28","text":"Any man who broke the law of Moses was killed, if two or three people proved that he had broken the law. He will not be forgiven."},{"verse":"29","text":"But the person who should have much bigger punishment is the one who turns against the Son of God.

Also, The Lord will judge his people."},{"verse":"31","text":"People should fear very much to be punished by the living God."},{"verse":"32","text":"Remember the first days when you had the light of Gods truth. In those days you were strong, even though you had to fight against many troubles."},{"verse":"33","text":"Sometimes it was because people said and did wrong things to you and everybody saw it. And sometimes it was because you stood with others who had wrong things done to them."},{"verse":"34","text":"You shared in the troubles of those who were in prison.
